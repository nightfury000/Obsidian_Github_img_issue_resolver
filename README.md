# Obsidian_Github_img_issue_resolver
Obsidian markdown uses little bit different syntax to render image than Github markdown, hence the image doesn't render, this will enable to solve the issue, hopefully.
Maybe there is need to use regex for patterns.
The plan is to create a script that replaces the obsidian img syntax to github img syntax so the image renders properly.
For example in this repo [DevOps notes repo](https://github.com/pineapples5972/GroupStudy/tree/main/DevOps/obsidian-Notes/DevOps) the images are not rendered properly. Link to [images](https://github.com/pineapples5972/GroupStudy/tree/main/DevOps/obsidian-Notes/attachments/Images)

- [x] Script to move images to a folder
- [ ] Script to replace obsidian syntax with github md syntax
- [ ] Github CI/CD
