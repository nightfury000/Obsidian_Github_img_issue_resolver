# Obsidian_Github_img_issue_resolver
Obsidian markdown uses little bit different syntax to render image than Github markdown, hence the image doesn't render, this will enable to solve the issue, hopefully.
Maybe there is need to use regex for patterns.
The plan is to create a script that replaces the obsidian img syntax to github img syntax so the image renders properly.
For example in this repo [DevOps notes repo](https://github.com/pineapples5972/GroupStudy/tree/main/DevOps/obsidian-Notes/DevOps) the images are not rendered properly. Link to [images](https://github.com/pineapples5972/GroupStudy/tree/main/DevOps/obsidian-Notes/attachments/Images)

- [ ] A generalised script that works for all files and images in that
- [ ] Making a Ci/Cd through github workflow (for e.g when one uploads a .md file and images first the image is syntax is replaced to match github readme syntax and then the images will directly be placed in https://github.com/nightfury000/Obsidian_Github_img_issue_resolver.git)
